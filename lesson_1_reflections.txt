Q1.)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
There were two files, one which contained the buggy code and the other one which
contained the correct code so using the diff helped in finding out the diff and
the one in the diff was the bug which we found out.

Q2.) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I think it can help in making me more efficient programmer in the way that we can constantly see the mistakes that we
made in our last code and keep in mind not to repeat the same or check for older code to better the performance the
running time of our new code.

Q3.)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros:
1. We can manually commit according to our convenience when required.
2. We can name the commit, the changes which we have made.

Cons:
1. If we are doing the things manually it may be the case that we forget to commit.
2. We may do the commit very oftenly which may not be required or we might do the commit
or bigger intervals making it difficult to clearly understand the changes that we did.
