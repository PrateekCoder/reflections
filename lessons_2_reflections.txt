Q1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository, a new .git file is added to the directory, which maintains a record of all the changes we make, basically all the commits we create.

Q2.)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is something which is not permanent, it is a kind of partial area where is data is stored only until the commit is done, once the commit is done, that staging area is vanishes.
It has a very important value as we can create commit for more than one files at same time, if this area would not have been there making commits for more than 1 file would not have been possible.
